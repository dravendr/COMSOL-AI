# COMSOL-AI
This repository is related to the paper：“Boosting optimization of membrane electrode assembly guided by explainable AI”. The machine learning code file was written in jupyter notebook and saved in the corresponding format of .ipynb. To run the code, we suggest users to install Anaconda 3 in windows 10 and install the following necessary python packages with the same or higher version to set up compatible environment: Python 3.7; jupyter 1.0.0; numpy 1.18.1; pandas 1.0.1; scikit-learn 0.22.1; matplotlib 3.1.3; shap 0.36.0; xgboost 1.0.2; lightgbm 2.3.1; catboost 0.23.2; tensorflow-gpu 1.14.0; eli5 0.10.1; keras 2.3.1 Multiphysics simulation model was built on COMSOL® and the mph file is uploaded as "multiphysics MEA.mph".
